# My Schedule

> In the "My Schedule" section, you will find all your tasks divided into several columns according to their status. Each column represents one of the life stages of the task. Task priorities are set by artificial intelligence based on many parameters. You will always see a complete overview in real time here, so you always know what to work on and when.

By clicking the drawer icon on the left side menu, you will get into the "My Schedule" where you can see all your planned tasks.

## Creating a task

Click on the "+" button in the lower right corner of your Schedule to open a window for creating a new task. You can also create a task in Project Formation™ and on a project in the same way.

- Enter the task name in the opened window.
- Set the estimated time of the task on the timeline.
- In the "Project" menu, select which project the task will be assigned to.
- The solver menu displays which user is assigned to the task. Click on the icon to open the list of users and select the task solver. It is possible to assign multiple solvers to the task. In this case, go to the bottom of the list and turn on the "Group collaboration at the coordinated time" option.
- The "Add Labels" menu is used to mark a task. Labels are used for better clarity and filtering/organisation between tasks (custom labels can be created and edited in the "Labels and categories" section, which can be found in the main menu of the application).
- The "Description" field is used to add more information about the task.
- Use the "Upload files" button to attach any required files from your device to the task. There is also the option to add a file from Google Drive, OneDrive or Dropbox.
- The postponed start works as the date from which the task is going to be scheduled on the Gantt.AI™ timeline. If you do not set a delayed start, the task is scheduled for the nearest possible time, according to AI algorithms.
- The deadline is for the final date to complete the task by. According to this deadline, artificial intelligence determines the priority among other tasks.

Click on the "Create" button to finish creating the task.

### Task detail

Click on the task name to open the task detail. It is very similar to the menu where you create the task. In the task detail you will find all the information about the task, which can be edited directly.

Through the "More" menu (three dots in the upper right corner of the detail), you can open the task in a new window, copy the task link, display all the tasks in a given project, display the task in the ProjectFormation™ graphical environment or delete the task.

You can also see an alert for an upcoming deadline in your Schedule list. If the set deadline is approaching, you will see an orange exclamation mark notifying you when the deadline would be exceeded. If the deadline has already been exceeded, you will see a red exclamation mark notifying you how long it is after the deadline.

**In the task detail you can find:**
- The name of the task and information about the creation date.
- Labels (which you can change after clicking the button)
- Assigned task solver (after clicking on the solver's avatar you have the option to change them or enable group collaboration at a coordinated time)
- Which project the task is assigned to (by clicking you display a drop-down menu of other projects where you can switch which one the task will be assigned to)
- Timeline with set estimated duration (can be modified and is visible for task solvers, project coordinators and management).
  - Task states:
    - “To-do” = the task is scheduled on the Gantt.AI™ timeline
	- “Working” = the task is being worked on and the stopwatch is running
	- “Done” = the task is completed
	- “Postponed” = the task cannot be worked on and is postponed until later
  - Task description - option to add a detailed description
- Attachments - files can be attached here
- Add a checklist that allows you to divide the task into several steps that need to be done to complete the task. Just type each step and add it to the list with the "Enter" key. You can delete any of these by clicking on the bin button on the right side of the step. In case of multiple solvers on a task, you can also immediately see who completed the step. It is not necessary to complete the checklist to complete  the task.
- Delayed start time - determines the date from which the task is going to be scheduled among other tasks on the Gantt.AI ™ timeline. If you do not set a delayed start, the task is scheduled for the earliest possible time based on priorities.
- Task deadline - this works as the final  date to complete the task by. According to this deadline, artificial intelligence determines the priority among other tasks.
- Comments on the task from colleagues. If anyone comments on a task you are part of, you will also receive a notification.
- Task history - by clicking on the "Show all" button, you will see the history of all actions that were performed on the task and also by whom.
- Time spent - time spent on a task measured with a stopwatch when the task is in the "Working" state. You can also add your own time record here.

**Note:** All changes must always be saved with the "Save changes" button in the lower right corner of the screen.

## Task status change

To change the status of a task, drag it to the corresponding column, or you can do it directly on the task detail using the buttons "To-do, Working, Done, Postponed". Management, coordinators and task founders can change the state of other solvers tasks. You can also set the status change in bulk by editing multiple tasks using the "Multi edit" button in the project overview.

### Starting work on a task
To start working on a task, drag its tile to the blue bounded area above the columns. After being dragged the stopwatch starts.

### Stopping work on a task
You can pause the work on the task at any time by dragging the tile back to the "To-do" column, or by clicking the "Pause" button in the blue bounded area.

### Completing a task
When the work on the task is completed, drag it to the "Done" column to close the task.

### Postponing a task
If you can't work on a task, drag it to the right "Postponed" column. After dragging, a menu will appear where you enter the reason and time for the postponement and confirm with the "Postpone" button.
