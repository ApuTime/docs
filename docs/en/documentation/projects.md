# Projects

> In this section you can find an overview of all projects you have access to, sorted according to their current priority. With projects that require your attention at the top, e.g. due to missing the completion date. Directly on the given project tile you can also see what percentage of the project is completed and to which category the project belongs.

By clicking on the folder icon on the left side menu, you will get to the "Projects" section and get an overview of all projects in the company.

## Creating a project

- Use the "+" button in the lower right corner to open the menu for creating a new project.
- Enter the project name in the "New project" menu.
- Assign the project to a category. Doing this will enable you to easily filter projects marked in this way.
- Set a deadline for its completion (this is an important step, because the deadline determines the priority among other projects on the Gantt.AI ™ timeline)
- You can also set a delayed start here (the date from which the project is going to be planned on Gantt.AI™).
- The "People" button displays a submenu where you can specify which users are assigned to this project.
- Once a user is assigned to the project, they have a default assigned role (rights) in that project. You can change the assigned role by clicking on the menu and then selecting from three options (Manager, Participant, Restricted Participant).

To finish creating the project , click on the "Create" button.
