# Subscription

> In the "Subscriptions" section, you can find a complete overview of your current license and all the settings. Subscriptions can be set at both, monthly and yearly intervals, but you can save up to $2376 at the yearly interval.

You can find the subscription in the "Subscription" menu in the upper right corner of the screen by clicking on the profile picture.

**Note:** You must have management rights to view and manage your subscription.

## Overview

In the subscription overview you can set, edit or check your subscription.

To set up a subscription, click on the "Subscribe" button. In the next step, fill in the payment details and confirm.

We use a highly secure Paylike payment gateway.

You can cancel your subscription at any time if you no longer wish to use our services.

You can choose from three packages, differing mainly in the size of the company and the storage. If you purchase a smaller package and want to add users or storage beyond it, you can do so separately at the listed prices.

If you had added an extra user and after some time you delete them from your workspace, you will receive unused credit for that user, which will be automatically transferred to your next payment.

You can also upgrade the package at any time according to your needs.
