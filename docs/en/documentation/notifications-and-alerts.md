# Notifications and alerts

>  Notifications are your information center. They contain all relevant notifications of any changes on tasks or projects, as well as information about who made the change.

## View notifications and alerts

Notifications are available below the bell icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Whenever something happens on a project or task which you are involved in, or you are assigned a new task, you get a notification. After clicking on the notification, you will be taken to the task detail.

All changes made on the task are traceable in the taskâ€™s history, which can be found at the bottom of the task detail on the "Comments" tab after selecting the "Show all" option.
