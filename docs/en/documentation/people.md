## Working hours
Working hours define the time periods for individual users into which the tasks assigned to them are scheduled. Therefore, it corresponds to the time frame in which the employees are available, e.g. when they are present in the office.

The working hours of individual employees are marked on the timeline.

**Setting working hours:**
Working hours are set to 8.00-16.00 by default. Only management can adjust working hours by clicking on "Set working hours" (suitcase icon). You just select the time zone (the default is Prague) and drag the dots to set the working time range.

If it is necessary to divide working hours into multiple sections, for example due to a break or multiple shifts in one day, you can add another set of hours by clicking on the "Add time slot" button. To remove any time slots, just click on the trash can icon.

The adjusted working hours can be restored to the default state using the "Reset" button.

## Remove a user
