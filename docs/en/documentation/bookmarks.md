## Bookmark management
You can also edit, move or delete your bookmarks using the "Manage bookmarks" option. You can find it at the bottom of the bookmarks window. Using the button on the left side, you can drag the bookmark to another position and thus, for example, sort them by importance. You can also use the pencil to rename the bookmark and delete a bookmark by clicking the trash icon.
