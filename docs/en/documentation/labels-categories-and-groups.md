# Labels, categories and groups

> Labels, categories and groups are used to identify tasks, projects and users for better organisation . If you mark tasks with these labels, you can use them to filter better. You will also have a clear overview of projects if you categorize them. User groups can be used for distinguishing individual departments.

By clicking on the label icon on the left side menu, you will get to the "Labels and categories" section where you can see all existing labels, categories and groups what tasks, projects and users are marked by them.
