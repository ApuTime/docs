## Search in the help guide

You can find the option to view the help guide in the "My Account" menu in the upper right corner of the screen by clicking on your profile picture. After clicking on the "Help" menu, a window is opened where you can find documentation containing a complete description of individual sections and functions there. You can also easily search through it using the search box where you enter a keyword, and get redirected to the part of the documentation dedicated to a given issue.
