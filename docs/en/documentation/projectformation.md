# ProjectFormation™

> In this graphics tool, the processes of individual projects are visualized. Thanks to the detailed process drawing of each project, our artificial intelligence optimizes the schedule and ensures a smooth workflow. You can also print records from ProjectFormation™.

By clicking on the folder icon on the left side menu, you will get to the ProjectFormation™ graphical interface.

## Creating a process template

If you do not have a map in progress, a window for creating a new map will appear. Enter the name of the map and click on the "Start drawing" button.

If you have a map in progress and you want to delete it to start a new one, click on its name (the first ProjectFormation™ icon in the control panel in the upper right window) and select the option "Draw new", or just rename it and continue drawing.

## Adding a task in ProjectFormation™

To add a new task, click the "+" button in the lower right corner (the window for adding and setting the very first task will be displayed automatically). You can also create a task in the project and in the "My Schedule" section.

- Enter the name of the task
- Set the estimated time of the task length on the timeline (the default setting is 45 minutes)
- Select solvers (figure icon). By default, the task is assigned to the process map creator.
- You can label a task for better clarity and filtering/organisation among other tasks.
- You can add more detailed information to the task in the "Description" field.
- The "Add a requirement" menu allows you to create a list of smaller subtasks (steps) to be completed within the task.
- Setting the relative deadline sets the task deadline automatically for a certain time from the creation date. Therefore, whenever you create a process map from a given template, the deadline is scheduled for the time of your choice (e.g. + 2 weeks from the creation of the project).
- Possibility to add the current user as a solver by default (e.g. useful when the project creator should also be a solver).

You can also edit all these steps or set them later in the task detail.

You can save the set task with the "Add task" button.

The created task is displayed as a tile in the ProjectFormation™ environment, where you can add other process tasks and create links between them within the project.

## Auto-place

You will also find the "Automatic placement" button on the floating bar. This is useful if you want to give the process map an order after it has been drawn. After clicking on this button, the process map will be arranged clearly and all sequences and connections can be seen well.

## Importing a process template
If you already have a process map stored on your PC, you can simply import it using the "Import" button, which can be found in the floating bar in the upper right corner after clicking on "More" (three dots).

## Exporting a process template
If you want to export (download) the process map, just use the "Export" button, which you will find in the floating bar in the upper right corner after clicking on "More" (three dots). Then the process map will be downloaded in .json format which can be saved or sent.

## Printing a process template
You can easily print the process map using the "Open printer" button, which can be found in the floating bar in the upper right corner after clicking on "More" (three dots). Your process map template will open in a new window in print quality and you just right-click anywhere in the window and select "Print".

## Editing tasks in ProjectFormation™
Long-click (or double-click) a tile to open the task settings for editing.
You can edit the task detail here in the same way as if you are creating a new task.

## Linking tasks in ProjectFormation™
If the project contains multiple tasks, you can link them by clicking and dragging from the "End" point on the tile of task A to the "Start" point of task B (in the project, this will mean that task A must be completed in order to start working on task B).

<figure>

		<figcaption>Linking tasks in ProjectFormation™</figcaption>
	</a>
</figure>

## Add a follow-up task in ProjectFormation™
You can also add a new task directly following the already created task.

- Click on the Start point to add a task before the selected task (i.e. the newly added task will precede the existing task).
- Click on the End point to add a task following the selected task (i.e. the newly added task will follow on from the existing task).

To delete links, hover over the link line and click the on the red cross.

## Pipelines in ProjectFormation™
Setting up pipelines between two tasks will cause the 2nd task to be automatically set to a delayed start (when scheduling in Gantt.AI™) or the deadline you set.

On the right side of the task tile, click on the green circle and drag to connect it to the task you need to set up the pipeline

The following data can be set in the pop-up window:
- Delayed start - when the task will  be scheduled only after completing the source task.
- Deadline - the date by which the task should be completed (deadline does not need to be set).

Save the pipeline with the "Set pipeline" button.

## Decision element in ProjectFormation™
Through the decision element, you have the opportunity to decide which way the process will continue after completing a task in the project. This means that any tasks following the decision element are scheduled  in the project only after a specific decision has been made.

To add a decision element, click on the "Add decision" icon.

Fill in the decision element question, which can only be answered YES / NO and click on "Add decision".

Links and interconnections work here the same as they do for tasks.

You can move tasks and decision elements as you wish (by clicking and dragging) on ​​the work screen.

		<figcaption>Decision element in ProjectFormation™</figcaption>
	</a>
</figure>

## Parallel tasks behind the decision element
If you need to insert more tasks in parallel for a decision element, you must use a task without a solver, which will serve as a divider (it closes automatically as soon as it comes to the it’s turn in the process) and then you place these tasks behind it.

To save each process map, click the ‘Save Map’ icon (blue floppy disk) in the controls.

There are also several other ways to save a process map.

- Create new project from mind map = creates a new project with tasks from the map.
- Save to existing project = the task map is saved to an existing project that may contain other tasks.
- Save as template = saves the map for later use.
