# Gantt.AI™ timeline

> Gantt.AI™ timeline always provides an up-to-date overview of the prioritization of individual user tasks. It indicates who works on what, and when. If you or your colleagues have calendar integration enabled, you can also see events scheduled for each user on the timeline. APU will not schedule any tasks for the occupied time. Task priorities are set by artificial intelligence based on many parameters. If there is any change, for example, the employee does not arrive at work, artificial intelligence finds the optimal solution and plans the entire schedule so everything is completed on time, as cheaply as possible and in the shortest possible time.

By clicking the graph icon on the left side menu, you can find the timeline and see an overview of the time schedule of everyone in the company.

## Project selection
Use the drop-down menu on the upper left corner of the Gantt.AI™ to select the specific project you are interested in. This will display only those users who are assigned in the project and the tasks contained in it will be highlighted in color. However, tasks from other projects will remain visible in order to see what influenced the planning of the selected project.

## Date
To display a specific time range, select the date with the arrows or edit it directly. Click on the "Today" button to quickly get back to the current day.

## Display format
You can view the timeline by days, weeks, or months. You can get an overview of the entire project and find out when the project will be worked on intensively and when fewer tasks are scheduled.

## Zooming in and out on the timeline

Use the magnifying glass to zoom in or out on the timeline.

**Note:** You can make most of the timeline by assigning a deadline only to tasks that actually require it. This leaves the artificial intelligence room to optimize your schedule. All you have to do is set a completion date for the project, and all tasks will be scheduled to achieve the project's completion by that date. If something does not go according to plan or an unexpected event occurs, the timeline is immediately rescheduled.

**Note:** Only projects with the AI ​​scheduling feature enabled are visible on the timeline. Projects that do not have this feature enabled cannot be scheduled on the timeline. It is important that only projects that are already prepared for processing (mapped in ProjectFormation™) are allowed for AI planning, otherwise subsequent changes would constantly interfere with the plan and APU would not be able to provide relevant estimates of the completion of other projects.

**Note:** It is not always possible to schedule a timeline where everything can be completed on time. In this case, APU will notify you about the probable non-completion of the task on time, or about an exceeded deadline.
