# Time spent

> In the "Time spent" section, you will find an overview of the time spent on tasks and projects as well as the costs of the tasks of individual employees, sorted in descending order by date. If the employee has an hourly rate set in the "People" section, you can also measure their cost for the worked time.

By clicking on the clock icon on the left side menu, you will get to the "Time spent" where you can see all the time spent on all tasks.

## View and edit time spent

- You can search for the time spent using the filter at the beginning of the section by employee (author), project (project) and date (worked).
- Expand the row to see details about the length of time spent on the task, where you can also add, edit, or remove your time record. You will also see a checkbox labeled "Billable'' there. This can be used if you have an hourly rate set for the user. When checked, you will see the cost of time spent on each task.
- Use the arrow in the details to view the detail of the task.
