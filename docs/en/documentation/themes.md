## Theme change

You can find the option to change themes in the "My Account" menu in the upper right corner  of the screen by clicking on your profile picture. After clicking on the "Theme" menu, you can choose which one you want to use.

Tip: Dark mode saves energy. This can be useful, for example, for reducing eye-strain at night.
