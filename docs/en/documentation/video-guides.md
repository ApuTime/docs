> Make the most of APU’s potential. Learn how to use advanced features or just get back to the basics anytime you need to. We made these short video tutorials to help you maximise APU’s utility.

## View video guides

Video guides are available under the tutorial icon in the upper right corner of the screen. In the menu, you can launch the interactive wizard that greeted you when you first launched the app, as well as watch video tutorials with brief overviews of APU’s features. After you finish the videos, they will be marked as watched, but you can still return to them at any time.
